The goal of the program is to generate strong, random passwords to enhance security for users.
The program first defines a pool of characters, which includes:

Lowercase letters (e.g., a-z)
Uppercase letters (e.g., A-Z)
Digits (e.g., 0-9)
Special characters (e.g., !@#$%^&*).
The program may allow users to specify:
Length of the password.
Whether to include special characters, digits, etc.
